Mathematical Calculations
To make the analysis quantitative:

Power Analysis:

Correlation coefficient between power consumption and Hamming weight.
Variance and standard deviation of power measurements.
Timing Attack:

Statistical t-test to determine if timing differences are significant.
Average and standard deviation of timing data for different keys.
Electromagnetic Analysis:

Fourier Transform to identify dominant frequencies in EM signals.
Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) calculation.
Acoustic Analysis:

Spectral centroid to find the "center of mass" of acoustic frequencies.
Cross-correlation to match acoustic patterns with specific operations.
